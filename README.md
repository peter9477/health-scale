# Health scale

Simple BLE utility to get readings from advertisements sent
from a weight scale and log them.

Currently the MAC address is hardcoded.  Obviously that
should be changed for anyone else...

And of course only one particular type of scale is supported,
and the data format had to be reverse engineered.
